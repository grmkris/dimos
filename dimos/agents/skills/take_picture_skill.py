"""Capture robot camera frames and upload them to the robomoo app.

Skills:
  - take_picture: one-shot capture of the current frame.
  - explore_and_capture: start autonomous exploration and take a photo every few
    seconds as the robot moves (deterministic — drives the cadence itself rather
    than relying on the agent to keep calling take_picture).

Each frame is JPEG-encoded and POSTed (with the robot's odom pose) to robomoo's
`/api/robot/frame` (shared-secret bearer token). Configure via env:

    ROBOMOO_URL=https://gateway-...up.railway.app
    ROBOT_INGEST_TOKEN=<secret matching the server>
